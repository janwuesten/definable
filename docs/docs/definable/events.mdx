# Events

## Benefits

By using events you can execture actions everytime your data is serialized or deserialized.
While most of the times events aren't necessary as you can use the serializer and deserializer to modify your class properties, events can be helpful in many situations.

Events are also called when only serializing or deserializing partial properties.

Possible events are:
- `deserialize.after`: Will be executed after the deserialization is done.
- `deserialize.before`: Will be executed before the deserialization is done.
- `serialize.after`: Will be executed after the serialization is done.
- `serialize.before`: Will be executed before the serialization is done.

When using a [validator](/definable/docs/definable/validation) with `useValidator` events will only trigger if all properties that are being serialized are valid.

## Defining an event

To define an event use the `useEvent` definer within your `definition` method.

```ts
import { Definable, DefinableDefinition } from "definable"

class MyFirstClass extends Definable {  
  myFirstProperty: string = ""

  //highlight-start
  definition({ useProp, useEvent }: DefinableDefinition): void {
    useEvent("serialize.before", () => {
      // your event action
    })
  //highlight-end

    useProp("myFirstProperty")
      .useSerializer<string>(() => this.myFirstProperty)
      // data will have the type "string | null"
      .useDeserializer<string>((data) => this.myFirstProperty = data ?? "")
  }
  
}
```
